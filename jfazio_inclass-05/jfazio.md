[arod]: media/arod.jpeg "Alex Rodriguez"

Alex Rodriguez is a former MLB shortstop and third baseman. He played 22 seasons in the American League for the Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, and New York Yankees. Rodriguez was one of baseball's most highly skilled atheletes and is considered one of the greatest offensive players of all time, despite controversy linked to performance enhancing drugs. Over his career, Rodriguez totaled a .297 batting average, 696 home runs, more than 2,000 RBI and runs scored, and over 3,000 hits. He is a 14-time American League All-Star and a three-time American League MVP; he also was awarded ten Silver Slugger Awards, and two Gold Glove Awards.

Rodriguez is also the record holder for career grand slams with 25. Before being suspended for the entirety of the 2014 season, he was belived to, one day, break the all time home run record set by Barry Bonds.

### Career Summary

The Mariners selected Rodriguez first overall in the 1993 MLB draft, and he debuted in the major leagues the following year at the age of 18. In 1996, he became the Mariners' starting shortstop and finished second in voting for the AL MVP Award. Rodriguez's combination of power, speed, and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise, but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers. The 10-year, $252 million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history. He played at a high level in his three years with Texas, highlighted by his first AL MVP Award win in 2003, but the team failed to make the playoffs during his tenure. Prior to the 2004 season, Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees, for whom he converted to a third baseman, because Derek Jeter was already the Yankees full-time shortstop. During Rodriguez's career with the Yankees, he was named AL MVP in 2005 and 2007. [~ Wikipedia]

#### Controversy

In February 2009, Selena Roberts and David Epstein of Sports Illustrated reported that Rodriguez had tested positive for two anabolic steroids, testosterone and Primobolan, during his 2003 season playing for the Texas Rangers, the same season in which he captured his first American League Most Valuable Player award, broke 300 career home runs (hitting 47 that year), and earned one of his ten Silver Slugger Awards. The information had been part of a government-sealed report detailing 104 major league players (out of 1200 players tested) who tested positive for performance enhancers during a 2003 drug survey. Approved by the players themselves with the promise of anonymity, the survey was conducted by Major League Baseball to see whether a mandatory drug testing program might be necessary. At the time, as the result of a collectively bargained union agreement, there was no penalty or punishment for a positive test. Because more than 5% of the samples taken from players in 2003 came back positive, mandatory testing of major league baseball players began in 2004, with penalties for violations. [~ Wikipedia]

On August 5, 2013, MLB suspended Rodriguez from August 8 through the end of the 2014 season for violating the league's PED policy in a 2013 Biogenesis scandal. He would originally miss a total of 211 regular-season games plus any postseason games. He was one of 13 players suspended for their roles in the scandal. In its official statement, MLB said that the suspension was based on Rodriguez's "use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including Testosterone and human Growth Hormone, over the course of multiple years" and "for attempting to cover-up his violations of the Program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the Office of the Commissioner's investigation." Although the standard punishment for a first offense under MLB's drug policy is 50 games, MLB had the option of suspending Rodriguez for longer than that under the collective bargaining agreement if it determined his actions constituted conduct detrimental to baseball.

After his performance, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred stated that Judge is a player "who can become the face of the game." On July 21, Judge a hit a home run that almost travelled out of Safeco Field. The ball was hit so hard that Statcast could not measure the details on the home run. [~ Wikipedia]

On September 25, Judge hit his 49th and 50th home runs, tying and surpassing Mark McGwire's single season rookie home run record.
