The informal term "big cat" is typically used to refer to any of the four largest members of the entire Panthera genus. In descending order of their maximum potential size, these three species are: tigers, lions, and jaguars, with the tiger (Panthera tigris) being the largest.

Despite enormous differences in size, various species of cat are quite similar in both structure and behaviour. All cats are carnivores and efficient apex predators. Their range includes the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe.
